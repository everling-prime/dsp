>Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups.

`CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)`

>How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

Cohen's D for prglngth: 0.029
Cohen's D for totalwgt_lb: -0.089

They are both very small differences from the mean, both less than a tenth of a standard deviation.
